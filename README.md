## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Jasperje/Jasperje** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on week 13 (the best number!) in a coding bootcamp, through PromineoTech.  I am currently in the back-end course, and once I complete it, I will pursue a second course as well! 

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  This is an 18-week course, so I just began the final third of the program.  The final third is devoted to learning REST APIs and also the final couple of weeks we will be working on our final project, showing our culminating knowledge from the entire course.  

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate:  I would love to find some opportunities to fill out the "experience" section of my resume! ğŸ˜†  Since I am completely new to the tech industry, I would love to find some volunteer opportunities where I would be able to learn some real-world skills.  I would be most interested in working for people or companies devoted to compassionate care and/or underserved / underrepresented populations - supporting education, healthcare, womens' health, queer communities, refugee or other minority communties, just to name a few ideas.
